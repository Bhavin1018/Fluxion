- Tablet (iPad, Android tablets)
- Mobile (iPhone, Android phones)

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Core Functionality Tests

Test these core features in each browser:

#### 1.1 Store Creation and Basic Operations
- Create store with initial state
- Update state with various methods
- Subscribe to state changes
- Unsubscribe from state changes

#### 1.2 React Integration
- Component rendering with store data
- Re-rendering on state changes
- Performance with multiple components

#### 1.3 Middleware Functionality
- Logger middleware
- Persistence middleware
- Custom middleware

### 2. Advanced Feature Tests

#### 2.1 Async Operations
- Async actions with loading states
- Error handling in async operations
- Cancellation of async operations

#### 2.2 DevTools Integration
- Connection to Redux DevTools
- Time-travel debugging
- State inspection

#### 2.3 Performance Edge Cases
- Large state objects
- Frequent updates
- Complex selectors

## Testing Tools

### Automated Testing

1. **Cross-browser Testing Platforms**
   - BrowserStack
   - Sauce Labs
   - LambdaTest

2. **Test Frameworks**
   - Jest + React Testing Library
   - Cypress
   - Playwright

### Manual Testing Checklist

For each browser, verify:

- [ ] Store initialization works correctly
- [ ] State updates are reflected in the UI
- [ ] Middleware functions as expected
- [ ] No console errors during normal operation
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with large state
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable over time
- [ ] DevTools integration works if supported

## Browser-Specific Considerations

### Safari
- Test with ITP (Intelligent Tracking Prevention) enabled
- Verify localStorage/sessionStorage persistence

### Internet Explorer 11 (if supported)
- Verify polyfills are working correctly
- Test with ES5 transpiled code
- Check for memory leaks

### Mobile Browsers
- Test with slow network conditions
- Verify touch interactions with state-driven UI
- Test with limited memory environments

## Compatibility Features

### Feature Detection

Implement feature detection for:

```javascript
// Example feature detection implementation
export const browserFeatures = {
  localStorage: (() => {
    try {
      localStorage.setItem('test', 'test');
      localStorage.removeItem('test');
      return true;
    } catch (e) {
      return false;
    }
  })(),
  
  indexedDB: typeof indexedDB !== 'undefined',
  
  serviceWorker: 'serviceWorker' in navigator,
  
  webWorker: typeof Worker !== 'undefined',
  
  // Add more feature detections as needed
};
```

### Fallback Mechanisms

Implement fallbacks for unsupported features:

```javascript
// Example storage adapter with fallbacks
export function createStorageAdapter() {
  // Try IndexedDB first
  if (browserFeatures.indexedDB) {
    return createIndexedDBStorageAdapter();
  }
  
  // Fall back to localStorage
  if (browserFeatures.localStorage) {
    return createLocalStorageAdapter();
  }
  
  // Fall back to memory storage
  console.warn('No persistent storage available, using memory storage');
  return createMemoryStorageAdapter();
}
```

## Reporting and Tracking

### Compatibility Issue Template

When reporting browser compatibility issues:

1. **Browser Information**
   - Browser name and version
   - Operating system and version
   - Device type (desktop, mobile, tablet)
   - Screen resolution

2. **Issue Details**
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Screenshots or videos (if applicable)

3. **Code Context**
   - Relevant code snippets
   - Store configuration
   - Middleware setup
   - React component structure (if applicable)

4. **Environment Information**
   - Fluxion version
   - React version (if applicable)
   - Any polyfills in use
   - Bundler and configuration

### Testing Workflow

1. **Initial Compatibility Testing**
   - Run automated tests across browser matrix
   - Document any failures or inconsistencies
   - Prioritize issues based on severity and user impact

2. **Regression Testing**
   - Before each release, test on primary browser targets
   - Ensure no new compatibility issues are introduced
   - Verify fixed issues remain resolved

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Configure CI pipeline to run tests on multiple browsers
   - Set up alerts for compatibility test failures
   - Track browser compatibility metrics over time

### Compatibility Reporting Dashboard

Implement a compatibility dashboard that shows:

- Current compatibility status across browser matrix
- Historical trends in compatibility issues
- Open issues by browser and priority
- Recent fixes and their impact

```javascript
// Example dashboard data structure
const compatibilityStatus = {
  browsers: {
    chrome: {
      latest: { status: 'pass', issues: 0 },
      'latest-1': { status: 'pass', issues: 1 },
      'latest-2': { status: 'partial', issues: 3 }
    },
    firefox: {
      latest: { status: 'pass', issues: 0 },
      'latest-1': { status: 'pass', issues: 0 },
      'latest-2': { status: 'pass', issues: 2 }
    },
    safari: {
      latest: { status: 'partial', issues: 2 },
      'latest-1': { status: 'partial', issues: 4 }
    },
    // Other browsers...
  },
  features: {
    'core-state-management': { status: 'full' },
    'async-operations': { status: 'full' },
    'persistence': { status: 'partial', notes: 'Safari ITP limitations' },
    'devtools': { status: 'partial', notes: 'Limited in IE11' }
  },
  trends: {
    // Historical data...
  }
};
```

## Conclusion

Browser compatibility is a critical aspect of maintaining a reliable state management library. By following this testing guide, implementing proper feature detection, and maintaining fallback mechanisms, Fluxion can provide a consistent experience across all supported browsers and environments.

Regular testing and reporting will help identify compatibility issues early and ensure they are addressed before they impact users. The compatibility dashboard will provide visibility into the current status and help prioritize fixes for the most critical issues.
